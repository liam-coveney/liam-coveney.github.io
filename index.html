                    <h2>Freelance Consulting and Web Development</h2>
                    <p>I worked as the principal developer with an artist and a member of the arts community that functioned as the creative director,
                        to build a website to suit the needs of the local music community in Bloomington. We worked together closely through several
                        iterations to ensure the client got the product that would make them most satisfied. It includes media from and about shows
                        including pictures and blog posts, hosts articles written by creatives, and provides a calendar promoting events and 
                        giving artists and venues a way to connect with each other to more easily book shows. I plan to expand the website throughout
                        this year to include a section for selling merchandise which I will receive a small commission for, and to allow for more users
                        interaction including a place for comments and reactions. I hope to expand this to be able to work with other artists and help
                        them fulfill their online presence needs. Check out the website!

                        experience and pictures/short videos from the shows viewable by their friends and the entire app community. I'm developing the app
                         in XCode using Swift with SwiftUI and the project is nearing completion, connected to Firebase, and is close to having full functionality.

                    <h2>Catan A.I.</h2>
                    <p>For my final project in an A.I. class I took, collaborating with 2 classmates using Github I developed a model
                        that is able to make intelligent decisions in the game of Catan. We used a forward checking
                        n-max algorithm that achieved significant success against bots and human players, with a 95% win rate against random
                        bots and significantly higher average points earned in a game. Our model differs
                        from others online by implementing trading and smart decision making for the first two(settlement) rounds.
                        This allows for a more complete playthrough of the game whereas others focus on just the main game rounds 
                        and many without trading. We tested our A.I. player using a model we adapted from one online on
                        <a href="https://github.com/kvombatkere/Catan-AI.git" target="_blank" id="linkToPage">another github project</a>. This
                        project was based on a similar idea, but we made sure to differ ours from theirs as mentioned above. 
                        See my team's full project and report on my <a href="https://github.com/liam-coveney/work-experience" target="_blank" id="linkToPage">github</a>.
                         If you'd like to play/watch it yourself download the files on my github and run HumanGame.py or BotGame.py
                        depending on whether you want to play or not. Watch it play a game agains random bots below!
                         It's one quick game but you can see that our player (Red) makes much more intelligent structures than the bots and 
                         prioritizes game mechanics that maximize points: Longest Road, Largest Army, and building settlements tactically
                         for the most rolls and resources.

                    <p id="BF">For a Data Mining & Analytics class that I took Junior year, I had a lot of freedom to decide what my final
                        project would be. I chose to analyze how effective humanitarian and developmental aid packages had been to 
                        the development of Burkina Faso. I mined data for markers of a country's development such as literacy,
                        maternal mortality, life span, and GDP, and analyzed the correlation their change had with humanitarian and
                        developmental aid spending. This was especially challenging because of the lack of good data in Burkina Faso,
                        but I ended with a final project I was very proud of. Check it out on my github or download it below!

                <h1>Hi! I'm Liam</h1>
                <p>Outside of Computer Science I'm passionate about music, my local community, and cars.
                    I spend most of my weekends in Bloomington going to local bands' shows, driving my friends through winding forest roads in my convertible,
                    or playing soccer with my intramural teammates whether on or off season. I regularly
                    take hours-long walks, usually listening to songs I like on repeat
                    and regularly getting upwards of 20,000 steps per day. I'm not an artist but I'm lucky enough to be
                    close friends with many whose work I really love. I try
                    to support the local arts community however I can, whether that's volunteering to help
                    at a club's music festival, making websites for artists and the community as a whole, or playing
                    local bands' new releases on my radio show. I also write a column in my club's zine, "Telecast", in 
                    which I review my 3 favorite recent albums.
                </p>
                <p>The most important aspect of my life is definitely my friends and I try to spend as much time with them as possible.
                    After Catan night on Wednesday I get poke bowls with my radio cohosts before our show, host a movie or mario kart night every Saturday,
                    and there's no better feeling than helping my friends when something in their car isn't working. 
                    I'm lucky enough to be close with a lot of talented people and have
                    been able to work with them on projects, be them mine or theirs. My friends have designed websites I then created,
                     helped me come up with branding strategies, and brainstormed names for my app. 
                    
                </p>
                <img src="images/goodPicOfMe2.jpg" alt="Local Music Festival Crowd focused on me" id="amp">
                <p>I have diverse academic interests, supplementing my STEM curriculum with literature heavy Philosophy classes
                    and by exploring whatever historical topic I find interesting at the time; recently I've been interested
                    in the origins of different religions and the commonalities between them. While I love to solve a Computer Science puzzle
                    with technical thinking, I also really enjoy studying and reflecting on human topics.
                    I spend a lot of time researching and learning about cars; with an aspirational project of swapping a manual transmission into my 1999 Saab 9-3 on my
                    to-do list, I have a lot to learn.
                </p>
                <p>Inside STEM I feel most at-home in fields that allow me to use my creativity and passions.
                    My experiences in Web/Mobile Development, Data Analysis, and Artificial Intelligence, especially AI Ethics
                    thus far have allowed me to answer questions I had and build systems or products I'm excited by.
                    With my personal, freelance, and class projects I've been able to explore and combine what I'm most enthusiastic about with my 
                    computer science expertise. I made a website to increase accesibility to my local music community, made
                    an app that lets users connect over their experiences at concerts and live shows, studied countries I'm interested in,
                     and made an AI that intelligently plays Catan. These projects have proven to me that mostly anything I could want to achieve
                     with computer science is within my grasp and have inspired me to continue to pursue my education with passion and curiosity.
